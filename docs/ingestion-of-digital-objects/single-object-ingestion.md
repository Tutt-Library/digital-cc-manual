*NOTE: If you have an object that will have multiple media datastreams
attached to it you must first create a Compound Object, see these [instructions][COMP_OBJ]
for creating compound objects.*

Single object ingestion is done through the Fedora Utilities site. Once
you go to Fedora Utilities there is an option on the left-hand side for
add object. Click add object and it will bring you to the single
ingestion screen.

Once you're on the screen, enter your title and alternative title if
necessary. Then list your creators, contributors, corporate
contributors, and/or creators as is appropriate for your object. If you
need to have more than one you can click the blue "+" next to the field
name.

Then add your abstract, administrative notes, and description before
moving onto the date, type, origin, genre, extent and language section.
Fill in as much detail for each field as possible as you proceed through
the form. The publisher and place of publication will be filled in for
you as "Colorado College" and "Colorado Springs, Colorado", feel free to
change these fields if they are not appropriate for your object. This
section is mainly for serials and also has a frequency field such as
"weekly" for the Catalyst and "blockly" for the Leviathan.

One of the most important sections is the topical, geographic, dates,
people and organization, and subjects section. Please fill as many as
possible, this is especially true when it comes to the student
publications. I would prefer it if there are at least three major
articles highlighted by subject as well as our normal key subjects of
'college publication', 'student publication', and 'student newspaper'
that are used for this type of object.

Once you finish with your subjects and keywords you will be asked to
fill out the basic project properties about the object youâ€™re uploading.
You can upload an image, a PDF, audio, or video model. You then enter
the PID of the collection you created for this object, or that was
already created for the object or the PID of the parent if it is part of
[a compound object][COMP_OBJ]. Then using the data stream upload
options choose the file that you were trying to upload for this object
and click add object which is a blue button on the bottom left of the
screen. Afterwards please double check that your object was ingested
correctly by checking the [Digital CC Beta website](https://digitalccbeta.coloradocollege.edu).
