# Indexing the Repository

One of the Fedora Utilities is the Indexer, this takes the metadata from
the objects added into Islandora and makes them viewable in Digital CC Beta.

The Indexer is located on the left-hand menu under “Index Repository”.

There are two options for indexing: single indexing or full index which
allows you to index the entire repository or everything added from a
specific date on.

## Single Index
![Index a single PID](/imgs/index-single-pid.png)

Enter “coccc:” and the PID then select the Production
Environment\* from the drop-down menu. Then run the indexer.

## Full Index 
![Full Index](/imgs/full-index.png)

Select the Production Environment from the drop down and
then run the indexer or select the date that you would like to run the
indexing from and then run the indexer.

\*The Production Environment is the live repository, the Test
Environment is a good place to practice as none of the changes to it
will show on the live repository.
