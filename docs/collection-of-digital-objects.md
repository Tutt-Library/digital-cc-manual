I collect objects from many different places on campus and when those
objects are ready to be ingested they will be stored on the digital
repository drive (**insert drive name/location**) under a folder with
your name. There's a spreadsheet of these objects in the drive that
notates priority and frequency as well as relevant information in notes.
The objects are organized by collection in both the hard drive and the
spreadsheet and when they're completed they should be marked off of the
spreadsheet.
