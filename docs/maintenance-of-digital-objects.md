# Maintenance of the Collection Metadata

## Edit PIDs MODS

*To maintain the metadata of a single pid or object*

Here you enter the PID of the object you are editing preceded by
“coccc:”. For example, if you were trying to edit the Safari test PDF
that is listed under the library test collection you would
enter “COCCC:27522” then click “load mods”.

This will bring up the
meta-data for that object. To edit a field click the green dot, this
will allow you to enter information into that field.

the field you were trying to edit such as “type of resource” or
“language”. For example to change languages enter the old value such as
“eng” and then the new value such as “English”. When you’re finished
filling out the form click “replace values” (the blue button at the
bottom of the form) then double check your work on the Beta interface.
